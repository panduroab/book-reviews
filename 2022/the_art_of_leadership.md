### 1. Career shift.
The management position is not a promotion, it is a career shift. As manager you should keep track of you and your team.

To keep track of yourself, the author give you a series of professional growth questions that you should be asking yourself time to time.

### 2. Working with humans.
I liked how author focuses on the humanity of the managers and the humans you manage. A manager should be mature and kind, this will help you to work with other humans and deal with human situations in the work environment.

### 3. Growth your team. 
Your job as a manager is to growth your team. Performance tracking, delegation and hiring are key skills to develop as a manager. The new manager spiral of death have good examples of what mistakes and routines you should avoid as new manager.

### 4. Biggest surprise
Lots of great lessons in this book. The author have a lot of knowledge and experience in the tech management world. 

However, some chapters are hard to read. It seems to me that those chapters were write for the pure enjoyment of the author. Great management book, but I'm not a fan of the author's style.
